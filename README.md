# Ram M. Kripa Assignment 1

My artwork explores the fragmented digital identities that companies construct based on their data collection practices. It depicts a confused individual standing in front of a wardrobe, each outfit representing a distinct persona assigned by different companies such as Google, LinkedIn, and Fitbit (the three comapnies I was able to collect my data from). The viewer experiences the artwork interactively, clicking on each companyâ€™s logo to reveal the persona assigned to me, complete with an outfit and a list of inferred attributes. This experience aims to highlight the dissonance between my true identity and the reductive, often inaccurate profiles created by these companies. By visualizing these personas as outfits in a closet, I emphasize how companies attempt to 'dress' us in identities that suit their commercial objectives, often disregarding the complexities of our real selves.

The artwork addresses the broader issue of the commodification of personal information in the digital age. It attempts to create an interactive experience, using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to engage the viewer in the process of exploration of user profiles. If I had time to develop this concept further, I would implement the artwork in a more engaging fashion, with real animations of the wardrobe so that it would actually look like the user is picking an outfit from the closet and then inspecting it, with the metrics of my persona on the side next to the image, in a dynamic element.
